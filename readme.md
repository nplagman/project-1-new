<h1><u>Nick's Jeopardy ReadMe</h1></u>
WDI8 Atlanta, Project 1; written in HTML, CSS and Javascript (well, technically JQuery).

##How It Works
You click a square and the question will appear in its own question box on the right. In that question box, there will be an input box where you can type in your answer.

Most answers account for a common spelling mistake and for whether or not you decide to capitalize proper names. If you get too casual, such as writing "tom" when the answer is "tom brady," you deserve to lose points because good Lord you're lazy. However, writing "brady" would be correct. Tom Brady and Brady would also be correct. But why would you capitalize Tom and not brady? For that reason, Tom brady would not be correct. So don't be a weirdo, be consistent.

After you enter your answer, click the submit button. I'm sorry, but at the moment hitting enter on the keyboard will cause serious problems (the big question box will disappear and you won't be able to select that question, again).

Also, do not click on another question square while a question is in progress, it will screw up. I will try to fix this as soon as I can; so unless you have any advice to offer, how bout you back off about it, mmk?

##Revisions Needed
I need to add a way to disable the gameboard while a question is in progress, so you aren't able to screw up the game. I don't want to hide the game board, I just want to make the question squares un-responsive to clicks while a question is awaiting an answer.

There's also no end to the game, except that once all of the questions have been attempted, there are no more questions to select.

##Features I Hope to Add
These are in addition to the aforementioned shortcomings, of course.

I hope to add one of two things, the ability to have one or two players, or a top score list so there's a point. Perhaps the latter would need to be timed, otherwise it's pointless to click on each question since you'll be answering them all at some point, anyway.

In the former case, with two players, you would need to allow each player to "buzz in"; this could be done by the left and right shift keys being the buzzer. If the first player to buzz in is correct, that ends the question and they choose the next one. If they're wrong, then there needs to be another input field so the 2nd player can answer - and a pass button if they choose not to. But a timer 

Either case would require a pass button since you lose money if you're wrong.
